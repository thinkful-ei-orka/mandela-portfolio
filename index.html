                <p> I am a web developer, music maven, and idea dispensary. I grew up watching Teal'c, Morpheus, and Major Kusanagi explore the final frontiers of space and the web. My background in natural resources and agriculture led me to explore different landscapes, thinking about additional software and hardware we need to be better explorers in life. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Remember all those moments where someone checked their device and pulled up some information that helped the team open the magic door and discover something new? I enjoy using my web development toolbelt with other developers to help businesses that do good interact better with the world and each other in the name of moving humanity forward.

                    <p>HayR is an application for online journaling used by companies to create a safe space to share feelings and thoughts. As you become more comfortable with entering a few words about your day or a simple moment as a reflection, you always have the option to reveal them to others anonymously. By sharing a reflection with the HayR community, you are able to see how others are during that day. When we accept and appreciate all thoughts and feelings that exist, we are able to appreciate the vastness of the human experience like stars in the night sky.</p>
